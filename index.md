# Short bio <a name="shortbio"></a>

I am the head of the Applied AI team at [Dolby Laboratories](https://www.dolby.com/) (since 2022). We do research on machine learning, with application to audio and multimodal analysis/synthesis. I was born in [Riudarenes](https://goo.gl/maps/w6cbtgExxNtDVCVq8), Girona (1980). I did an MSc and PhD in machine learning for audio at the [Music Technology Group](http://mtg.upf.edu/) of [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](http://www.upf.edu/) (2006-2011) and a postdoc in artificial intelligence at [IIIA-CSIC](http://iiia.csic.es/) (2011-2015). After that, I joined [Telefónica R&D](http://www.tid.es/) as a machine learning researcher (2015-2019) and, later, [Dolby Laboratories](https://www.dolby.com/) as an AI staff researcher (2019-2022). I have had research stays at the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/) (2010) and the [Max Planck Institute for Computer Science](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) (2011). I have been involved in several research projects, funded by National and European institutions, and co-authored over 100 publications, many of them highly-cited and/or in top-tier venues. I occasionally act as reviewer or area chair for some of those venues (provided articles are free access/charge), and give talks and lectures on subjects of my interest (lately basically related to deep learning and generative modeling).
